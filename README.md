Space Game
==========

NOTE: It's currently very broken, it will run but you won't be able to shoot. I'm currently reworking the way weapons work, as well as adding unit tests (to stop it from getting into this state in future!)

A space game written in Python.

What
----

It's currently a very simple arcade space shooter. But it does have BULLETS THAT ARE GUNS THAT SHOOT MORE BULLETS. Beat that eh.

How to run
----------

"Space game" is a Python program. You run it with Python:

    ./run.py

or

    python2 run.py

Running the tests
-----------------

At present, you would do e.g.

    python2 -m unittest src.tests.utils_test

from the root directory. I haven't yet invesitgated a better or more automatic way of doing this.

Dependencies
------------

In order to run "Space game," you will need the following packages installed:

* Python 2.7
* pygame
* pymunk
* scipy / numpy
* pyYAML

Controls
--------

WASD - Move.
QE - Rotate

Mouse - Shoot.

Why?
----

We'll see. Perhaps it will become a fun game. It's also an exercise in architecting a simple game reasonably cleanly. It's a work in progress.
