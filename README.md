What
----

It's currently a very simple arcade space shooter. But it does have BULLETS THAT ARE GUNS THAT SHOOT MORE BULLETS. Beat that eh.

Dependencies
------------

In order to run "Space game," you will need the following packages installed:

* Python 2.7
* pygame
* pymunk
* scipy / numpy
* pyYAML

The easiest way to install the libraries is `pip3 install pygame pymunk scipy pyyaml`.

How to run
----------

"Space game" is a Python program. You run it with Python:

    ./run.py

or 

    python2 run.py

Controls
--------

    w: Move forwards
    s: Move backwards
    a: Move left
    d: Move right
    e: Rotate anticlockwise

Profiling

which will spit out a file called 'profile_results' in the current working 
directory. You can view the results with

    ./bin/print_profile_results

Why?
----

We'll see. Perhaps it will become a fun game. It's also an exercise in architecting a simple game reasonably cleanly. It's a work in progress.
