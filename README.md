What
----

It's currently a very simple arcade space shooter. But it does have BULLETS THAT ARE GUNS THAT SHOOT MORE BULLETS. Beat that eh.

Dependencies
------------

In order to run "Space game," you will need the following packages installed:

* Python 3 (should work fine on 2.7, though)
* pygame
* pymunk
* scipy / numpy
* pyYAML

The easiest way to install the libraries is `pip3 install pygame pymunk scipy pyyaml`.

How to run
----------

"Space game" is a Python program. You run it with Python:

    ./run.py

or 

    python run.py

Controls
--------

WASD - Move.

QE - Rotate.

TG - Zoom.

RF - Cycle weapons.

Mouse - Shoot.

Running the tests
-----------------

At present, you would do e.g.

    python -m unittest src.tests.utils_test

from the root directory. I haven't yet invesitgated a better or more automatic way of doing this.

Profiling
---------

You can run with profiling enabled like so:

    ./run.py --profile

which will spit out a file called 'profile_results' in the current working 
directory. You can view the results with

    ./bin/print_profile_results

Why?
----

We'll see. Perhaps it will become a fun game. It's also an exercise in architecting a simple game reasonably cleanly. It's a work in progress.
