"""
An entity component system.

An 'entity' is an identity. It can be associated 'components'. A component
imbues an entity with an aspect of state and behaviour. A entity can be
associated with a single component of a given type.

Entities can be 'owned' by other entities. This ties their lifetimes together -
when a parent entity is destroyed, its children are destroyed too. The parents
and children of an entity can be enquired.

Entities live in an 'entity manager'. This is the central database that
associates entities with components.

Entity creation and component addition are done by calling methods on the
entity manager. This doesn't affect the current state of the entity manager
until the end of the current frame - this avoids adding items to the entity
manager in the middle of an update(),

If a config is passed into create_entity(), then components can be instantiated
dynamically. The '**kwargs' argument is forwarded to the setup() method on each
component as it is added.  Components types are read from the 'components' map
in the config, each component entry is passed into the created component as its
config.  For instance:

    components:
      src.behaviours.Team:
        team: player
      src.physics.Body:
        mass: 100
        size: 35

specifies an entity with two components, a Body and a Team.  The team defaults
to the 'player' team, and the body has a default mass and size.  If we do

    entity = ecs.create_entity("my_config.txt", team='enemy')

then the Team component's setup() method knows to instead be on the 'enemy'
team, which is extracted from the **kwargs.

Entity processing 'systems' can be registered with the entity manager. A system
operates on a subset of the entities in the manager, determined by a query.
Systems can be update()ed, allowing them to make changes to the entities they
operate on.

Global services are exposed via a 'game services' object.  This is injected
into each component.
