"""
A space game written in Python.

It currently depends on pygame for windowing, event handling etc, and on
pymunk for physics.

The program is structured with the intention than various distinct concerns
can be separated. The implementation of physics and the implementation of
drawing know nothing about one another, for instance. This is a work in progress
though. I'd like to make it realise this ideal more.

Entity creation is data-driven. Entities are defined in configuration
.txt files containing json data; these live under res/configs.

Things I would like to work on now:

1) Make it more of a game i.e. support controllers, add more types of enemy,
   weapon etc.

2) Make the use of pymunk more idiomatic. It's currently horrendous.
